# SquidwardInReal
Squidward Is Real.... AND HE'S IN NITW RUN!!!

This is a mod for NITW that adds Squidward PNG inside NITW.

Unlike my other character mod, PeterGriffin, this uses a callback technique rather than a Destroy technique.

This means that instead of having to call Destroy every 0.2 seconds, I can just load the script once everytime a scene has been loaded.

Anyways, you know the drill.

Follow this guide and build the project!
